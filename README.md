# Real-Time Web @cmda-minor-web Â· 2018-2019

## Summary
A webapp using websockets to filter realtime Reddit comments.
![App](../master/docs/images/app.png)

## Usage
Clone it
```
git clone https://github.com/Arash217/real-time-web-1819
```

Install dependencies
```
npm install
```

Start the server
```
npm start
```

### Mongo database config
create config/db.json with the following format:
```
{
  "username": <database-username>,
  "password": <database-password>,
  "host": <host>,
  "port": <host-port>,
  "database": <database-name>
}
```

## Concept
This webapplication filters a live stream of Reddit comments and displays it to the user.

Features of the app:
- User can filter comments by using the input field in the webapp
- Comments statistics to see the comments per minute for a search, and top 10 searches all time (of all users)
- Login system to keep track of a user's search history

## API
The app uses [Reddit SSE Stream](https://github.com/pushshift/reddit_sse_stream) to get a live feed of near real-time Reddit data by using server-sent events. The API doesn't require an API key, but does limit the connection to only one per IP.

The API allows me to filter only the required data, returning the following data format:
```
{  
   "body":"Horrible! But what're the names of buildings involved?",
   "permalink":"\/r\/aggies\/comments\/bqqoza\/tamu_transit_employee_arrested_for_hiding_a\/eo71p94\/",
   "subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/aggies",
   "author":"randomUser5"
}
```

Note: this isn't the official Reddit API.
